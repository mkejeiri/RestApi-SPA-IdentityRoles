-------------------------------------------
Extended User Class and adding photo Class
-------------------------------------------
1- specifying a navigation property such as public ICollection<Photo> Photos { get; set; } won't allow delete on cascade
   we will get a 'onDelete: ReferentialAction.Restrict', we won't change migration code because is auto-gen to correct this public  

2- dotnet ef migrations remove : will remove the last migrations
3- after we run : 'dotnet ef database update' we no longer be able to revert back to the previous stage
e.g :  'dotnet ef database update AddUserEntity' will fail due to sqlite and not EF, see for more...
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/providers/sqlite/limitations

4- we could drop the database and run migration until the point of 'AddUserEntity'
and we need to seed the db based on json file
    a- 'dotnet ef database drop', migrations will be stil available
    b- 'dotnet ef database update AddUserEntity'
    c- do the necessary changes to allow the delete on cascade : change the nav property accordingly
        add to photo Class: 
        public User User { get; set; }
        public int UserId { get; set; }

    d- remove the old migrations: 'dotnet ef migrations remove' & 
        add the new one 'dotnet ef migrations add ExtendedUserClass' &
        run 'dotnet ef database update' again.


5- to generate a seed based on a json file visit : https://www.json-generator.com/
6- inject the seed in startup : services.AddTransient<Seed>() and call for seeder.SeedUser();
7- we need to create DTO for User and Photo so to hide and recalculate sensible fields (hashed pass and salt), 
    - a : an automapper (nuget : AutoMapper.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection -Version 4.1.1)
    is available to map the field between our entities and DTO's
    - b: need to be injected and also the mapping is done through the class Helpers.AutoMapperProfile
8- an UsersController need to be created and to be protected
9- so far, all the tests are run through postman!!! 

-------------------------------------------
Update API to receive a put request and update a profile
-------------------------------------------
- update UsersController by adding
[HttpPut("{id}")]
            public async Task<IActionResult> UpdateUser(int id, UserForUpdateDto userForUpdateDto)
            {   

                /*
                  we need to match the user attempting to update his profile matching the 
                  id which part of the token in the server
                */         
                if (id != int.Parse(User.FindFirst(ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier).Value))   return Unauthorized();
                
                var userFroRepo = await _repo.GetUser(id);  
                _mapper.Map(userForUpdateDto, userFroRepo); 

                if (await _repo.SaveAll()) return NoContent();
                
                throw new Exception($"updating user with {id} failed");
            }

    ---------------------------------------------------------
    photos(upload, removal, profile update,...), adding PhotosController, Couldinary Cloud
    --------------------------------------------------------
        1- Create a Couldinary account:
            Cloud name : dzaqp6jnu
            API key:813335792476897
            API secret: QFuIZGlEEqT9CT1_V9cL6A1D5ns
            Environment variable:cloudinary://813335792476897:QFuIZGlEEqT9CT1_V9cL6A1D5ns@dzaqp6jnu/
            Cloudinary::Uploader.upload("sample.jpg", :crop => "limit", :tags => "samples", :width => 3000, :height => 2000)
            See doc for .Net : https://cloudinary.com/documentation/dotnet_integration#_net_getting_started_guide

        2- Create a photosController which take a photo and upload it to Cloudinary.
        3- delete photo from database and cloudinary
        4- control if the user has the right access before changing anything in his profile!
        5- rendering of customs entities (DTO's) instead of real entities to keep sensible data from leaking out
        6- AutoMapper usage between  customs entities (DTO's) and persisted entities.
        7- adding PhotosController for photos management

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Expanding register functionality
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1- receiving data from the form and expanding the register functionality:
    expanding UserForRegisterDto and implement the approriate mapping with user business entity.
2- after registration send CreatedAtRoute with UserForRegisterDto data.
        a- send location header (url to the newly created user) as well as the resource we created 
            (newly created user = userToReturn).
        b- 'GetUser' method is in UsersController (another controller) we need to provide that value 
            return CreatedAtRoute("GetUser", new { Controller="Users", id = userToCreate.Id }, userToReturn);


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action filter : attribute that could apply to anything : class, method, etc
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1- create a LogUserActivity Helper class that implement IAsyncActionFiller
2- add LogUserActivity as a service (ServiceFilter) to the startup class : services.AddScoped<LogUserActivity>()
3- Decorate the UserController with [ServiceFilter(typeof(LogUserActivity))] ,
   so the service will run after each actionResult method is completed in the UserController

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pagination: http://localhost:5000/api/users?pageSize=2&PageNumber=6
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 - we create a generic PagedList<T>: List<T> Helper class : all magic of differed quering 
    is done here and run on DB side (not controller side) that to IQueryable interface.

2 - we create a PaginationHeader to send a header info for our request

3 - create AddPagination Extensions method for HttpResponse and add the PaginationHeader 
    as Serializable Json stream into the request. we need also expose the header
4- angular deal with camelcase format otherwise we get in the header:
    Pagination →{"CurrentPage":1,"ItemsPerPage":3,"TotalItems":3,"TotalPages":4}
    we will get : Pagination →{"currentPage":1,"itemsPerPage":3,"totalItems":3,"totalPages":4
            var camelCaseFormatter = new JsonSerializerSettings();
            camelCaseFormatter.ContractResolver = new CamelCasePropertyNamesContractResolver();
            response.Headers.Add("Pagination", JsonConvert.SerializeObject(paginationHeader,camelCaseFormatter));

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fitlering & pagination  & sorting
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- We pass all our userParams in the header (gender, minAge, maxAge, orderBy)
- API receives an userParams object and pass it to the repository to get the relevant data


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
like functionality : adding liker and likee entities
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1- EF fluent API (self referenced table): create a many to many relationship from users to users based on like entiry (likerId, LikeeId)
2- create the entity (self referenced) : 
     public class Like
    {
        public int LikerId { get; set; }
        public int LikeeId { get; set; }
        // e.g : a user (likee) could like many users 
        // and could be liked by many other users (likers)
        public User Likes { get; set; }
        public User Liker { get; set; }        
    }

3- add navigation property to user entity : 
        public ICollection<Like> Likers { get; set; }
        public ICollection<Like> Likees { get; set; }

4- Use EF fluent API OnModelCreating:
        public DbSet<Like> Likes { get; set; }
        protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder){
                    //form the PK: LikerId + LikeeId
                    modelBuilder.Entity<Like>()
                    .HasKey(k => new {k.LikerId, k.LikeeId});

                    //Liker could have many likees : 
                    //e.g : a user (likee) could like many users and could be liked by many other users (likers)
                    modelBuilder.Entity<Like>()
                    .HasOne(u => u.Liker)
                    .WithMany(u => u.Likees)
                    .HasForeignKey( f => f.LikerId)
                    .OnDelete(DeleteBehavior.Restrict);

                    //Likee could have many likers
                    //e.g : a user (likee) could like many users and could be liked by many other users (likers)
                    modelBuilder.Entity<Like>()
                    .HasOne(u => u.Likee)
                    .WithMany(u => u.Likers)
                    .HasForeignKey(f => f.LikeeId)
                    .OnDelete(DeleteBehavior.Restrict);
                }

5- add a post request IActionResult handler LikeUser

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Messages functionality
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 - Create the proper entity Messages, do the EF (context & fluent API for relationship with the user)
2 - Create MessageController with all IActionResult
3 - Return paginated result 
4 - Add new Messages
5 - manage read/unread, inbox/outbox and thread(conversation) messages
6-  chat functionality, mark as read messages


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Publishing the DatingApp :
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0- Seed only if there is no user in the DB
1- config the distribution to point to API 'wwwroot' folder and use ng build, see 
   the available options for optimization. Obviously ng build will create a big file (~4MB),
   we need to optimize this. 
   a- ng build --prod (= ng build --prod --build-optimizer=true) will allow ahead of time (aot vs JIT in dev mode) compilation, and since
       the aot compilation is already done, the vendor.js (sizeable file which includes angular compiler)
       will be needed no more!.  
       minification + uglyfication (dead code algorithm -> unused/dead code removal) will implicitly take place       

        I M P O R T A N T => - ng build includes : Bundling, minification, tree shaking (dead-code elimination),
                             output hashing, AoT compilation. more info...: https://webpack.js.org/guides/       
                             - JIT=ng serve (vs AoT) use in Dev mode will load the following output files in memory: 
                                --------(DO NOT EXIST physically = just in memory)--------- 
                                Date: 2018-10-07T10:08:03.160Z
                                Hash: 50a7bde4436787d551d1
                                Time: 8950ms
                                chunk {main} main.js, main.js.map (main) 162 kB [initial] [rendered]
                                chunk {polyfills} polyfills.js, polyfills.js.map (polyfills) 227 kB [initial] [rendered]
                                chunk {runtime} runtime.js, runtime.js.map (runtime) 6.22 kB [entry] [rendered]
                                chunk {scripts} scripts.js, scripts.js.map (scripts) 140 kB  [rendered]
                                chunk {styles} styles.js, styles.js.map (styles) 353 kB [initial] [rendered]
                                chunk {vendor} vendor.js, vendor.js.map (vendor) 4.89 MB [initial] 

                            - AoT benefits : 
                                    - faster rendering: no need to wait for compilation
                                    - Few async requests: AoT compiler also inlines HTML templates and CSS files 
                                                          and help reduce the amount of asynchronous requests sent by the application,
                                                          so less async request, html/css templates are inline JS bundled directly into the app.
                                    - smaller framework download size : no need to download the compiler (vendor.js) - app already compiled 
                                    - detect template errors earlier
                                    - better security: fewer opportunity injection attach, no css or html template to read.


   b- ng build --prod will optimize the source code in such a way that it will affect alertify functionality,
      that why we need to use  ng build --prod --build-optimizer=false
   c- with ng build the name of the file is hashed (output hashing) which means it time a file content change the client 
      is forced to get the lastest Version!!!    
2-Order matters for serving SPA (static files) in startup.cs file
    a-  app.UseDefaultFiles(); //look for html index (or asp, php, ....)
    b-  app.UseStaticFiles();  //serve static file from wwwroot folder. 

3- How to deal with the issue of refreshing SPA routed pages and prevent API to override the 
   the SPA routing, basically we need to tell the API what should do with the unknow route!!!
   a- we give  app.UseMvc() some route configuration and create a dedicated controller (Fallback) 
   to deal with this:
                app.UseMvc(routes => {
                            routes.MapSpaFallbackRoute(
                                    name: "spa-fallback",
                                    defaults: new {
                                        controller = "Fallback", //Controller name to use
                                        action ="Index" //action method to call in the Fallback controller
                                    }
                                );
                            });
                
                public class Fallback : Controller 
                {
                    IActionResult Index(){
                        //return a physical full path filename : index.html
                        return PhysicalFile(Path.Combine(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory(), 
                        "wwwroot","index.html"),"text/HTML");
                    }
                }



   b- those change imply that we need to restart kestrel server (dotnet watch run doesn't work!). 

- 4 : we need to set 'environment.prod.ts' file
            export const environment = {
            production: true,
            apiUrl: 'api/'
            };

- 5 : since we serving SPA from the same domaine we don't need to configure whitelistedDomains for JwtModule

- 6: Solving EF the warning : when using 'includes' in DbContext and not returning the type that we suppose to return EF give this warning 
    Here : we cause we do a count on the IQueryable before returning a PagedList<User> (see CreateAsync in PagedList class) 
    The Include operation for navigation '[m].Recipient.Photos' is unnecessary and was ignored 
    because the navigation is not reachable in the final query results. 
    See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/querying/related-data

    services.AddDbContext<DataContext>(x => x.UseMySql(Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection"))
    .ConfigureWarnings(warnings => warnings.Ignore(CoreEventId.IncludeIgnoredWarning))); 

7- dotnet ef migrations script -o datingApp-mysql.sql
8- mysql operations:    
    - create DDL for DB: dotnet ef migrations script -o datingApp-mysql.sql 
    - create DB: mysql> Create database datingApp   
    - run the script: mysql> source ./datingApp-mysql.sql
